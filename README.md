# Docker compose
The docker-files in the different service folders should be executed from the git root.

The following environment variables should be used within the docker-compose files:
- `NODE_ENV` -> Set as `NODE_ENV` during building
- `NODE_CMD` -> Command to execute to start the container, either `start` for development with automatic restarting or `production` for production.

# Shared libraries
Are in the libraries folder. The folder name should match their package name on npm so that during build the code can be rewritten to make regex pattern `(\.\./)*libraries/amqpmessaging/index.js` -> `@amicopo/amqpmessaging/index.js`

# Shared databases
In production each service should have their own database. In the docker-compose.yml files every service has their own mongodb service. However, because these all have the same name only one will be created and all services will communicate with the same mongodb database.
